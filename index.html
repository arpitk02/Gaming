            <h3 class="display-5"> What are Game Engines?</h3>
            <p class="lead">You might have heard the term before but never really knew what a “Game engine” is exactly.<br>
          
          Perhaps the best way to understand is by learning what their purpose is.
          
          A game engine is the architecture that developers use to run the game.<br>
          
          Your average game engine provides developers with a way to add things like:<br>
          
          <ul>
          
          <li>Physics</li>
          <li>Input</li>
          <li>Rendering</li>
          <li>Scripting</li>
          <li>Collision detection</li>
          <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
          <li>More without the need to program them</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
            <h3 class="display-5"> Why Are They Important?</h3>
            <p class="lead">
          
               Game engines are reusable components developers use to build the framework of the game.<br>
          
               This gives them more time to focus on the unique elements like character models, textures, how objects interact, etc.<br>
          
               If everyone made their games from scratch without the help of excellent game engines, games would take longer and it will be more<br> difficult to make such games.<br>

            <h3 class="display-5"> What is Esports?</h3>
            <p class="lead">Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) 
                 is a form of sport competition using video games. Esports describes the world of competitive, 
                 organized video gaming. Competitors from different leagues or teams face off in the same games 
                 that are popular with at-home gamers: Fortnite, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, 
                 Overwatch and Madden NFL, to name a few. These gamers are watched and followed by millions of fans
                  all over the world, who attend live events or tune in on TV or online. Streaming services like Twitch 
                  allow viewers to watch as their favorite gamers play in real time, and this is typically where popular 
                  gamers build up their fandoms.

            <h3 class="display-5">Who watches Esports?</h3>
            <p class="lead">
          
          A lot of people. According to a report from Newzoo, a market analytics company, 
          380 million people worldwide watch esports, including 165 million esports 
          enthusiasts (a term that describes frequent viewers, as opposed to occasional viewers). 
          The bulk of these enthusiasts watch from North America, China and South Korea.
          According to research from Newzoo, 588 major esports events were held in 2017.<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          <h3 class="display-5">Where's the money in eSports?</h3>
            <p class="lead">
          
              With plenty of cash flowing into the picture, how do eSports teams and players earn money?
              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li> <b>Cash prizes:- </b> There is no shortage of prize money available to eSports gaming participants,
                       with single-game cash earnings up to $200,000. Some high-level competitions, like Dota 2 
                       International, earns $10 million to the competition's winning team. 
                  </li>
                  <br>
          
                  <li> <b>Team salaries:- </b> Esports offers regular salaries to team participants,
                       with average salaries in the $3,000-to-$5,000 monthly in gaming hotbeds like 
                       China and the U.S. Top echelon players can earn much more, up to $15,000 for a 
                       single competition plus bonuses. Some teams even offer their players perks like 
                       health insurance and retirement plans. 
                 </li>
                 <br>
          
                 <li> <b>Sponsorship money:- </b> With major global brands in the picture, eSports is 
                   raking in the sponsorship cash. Some of that money goes into competition and cash prizes, 
                   and some go directly to team ownership, as is the case with Audi and its sponsorship of 
                   Astralis Counter Strike franchise. Sponsors comprise $456 million of the overall $1.1 billion
                   in eSports revenues this year, Newzoo reports. 
                 </li>
                 <br>
                 
                 <li> <b>Merchandising and tickets:- </b> At $103 million in revenues in 2019, 
                   merchandising and tickets are among the top tier leaders in eSports payouts.
                   That said, merchandising usually follows the ascension of a sport, as it 
                   historically has on the PGA tour, in the NFL and NBA, and in other popular 
                   professional sports leagues. Expect both merchandising and ticket revenues to 
                   climb as gaming continues to flourish on a global stage.

              Competitive gaming has been a popular pastime for decades, 
              but the money and industry around the top esports games is a relatively
               recent development.
               Esports is a multi-billion dollar industry that includes a plethora of titles in every genre,
               from shooters to simulators and everything in-between. In no particular order, here are the
               top esports games in 2020 based on a number of factors, including viewership, events, and overall success.

              <h3 style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px; text-decoration: underline;">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
              <br>
              <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/" ><img src="csgo.jpg" style="margin:10px 0px 10px 70px;"></a>
              <br>
              <p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Eight years since the launch of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and it
               has maintained its position as one of the top esports games in the world, with
                frequent updates to the game, a lucrative market in weapon skins and knives, and 
                a flurry of events every year. Alongside ongoing leagues like the BLAST Premier and 
                ESL Pro League, 2020 has plenty of top tier tournaments like IEM Katowice 2020, DreamHack
                 Anaheim, and both ESL One events in Rio de Janeiro and Cologne respectively.
          
                When it comes to viewership, the biggest tournament in 2019 for CS:GO was the IEM Katowice major, 
                which accumulated 1.2 million views with a $1 million prize pool. This is another million in the total 
                prize money awarded since 2013, which is currently at just over $91 million.

              <br>
              <p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Perhaps the most famous esport in the world, 
                  League of Legends (LoL) is one of two Massive Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) dominating
                   the esports industry. It's been almost 11 years since LoL launched, and the grand total
                    prize money awarded is a whopping $73.5m across over 2,400 events.
                    South Korea is by far the most popular and successful market for LoL, with eight of the top 10 earners
                     hailing from the nation. In fact, only one player in the top 25 — Luka "PerkZ" Perkovic — comes from a
                      country other than South Korea or China, showing the popularity and dominance of the two Asian countries 
                      within LoL.

              <p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Some will say Fortnite isn't a proper esport due to Epic's 
                  tendency to roll out changes right before big events and reluctancy to maintain a healthy competitive metagame, 
                  but that doesn't detract from the fact that over $80 million has been given out in rewards in just over two years.
                   The game took the world by storm when it launched in September 2017 and while the buzz in the general media has died out, 
                   the esports scene is still thriving.How many people play Fortnite is a question plenty of people ask, and as of March 2019 – 
                   so almost a year ago – Fortnite had 250 million registered users.

              <p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Dota 2 is the only direct competitor to League of Legends and it comes from Valve, 
                  the same studio behind CS:GO. While LoL is immensely popular in Asian regions, the top 25 earners in Dota 2 are spread across
                   16 different nations, including the U.S.A, China, France, and Romania.
                   When it comes to prize money, Dota 2 blows every other title out of the water thanks to the method of funding used.
                   25% of all proceeds go towards The International prize pool, which meant that The International 2019 had a whopping $34.3m available, 
                   on top of the $200m+ that has been on offer over the years.

              <p style="margin: 0px 200px 50px 70px;">Of course, these aren't the only esports. There's hundreds of games played at a competitive level, 
                  including Farming Simulator – seriously. Titles that just missed out on a spot in the top list include both PUBG and Apex Legends, 
                  two successful battle royale games that are unfortunately living in the shadow of Fortnite. There's also PUBG Mobile, which is impressively
                   even more popular than its mainstream counterpart.
                   <br>
                   One of the only esports to be played on console, the competitive Call of Duty scene is unique in the fact it moves on to a brand new title every year.
                    Thanks to Call of Duty's annual release schedule, players have to learn the ins and outs of a whole new game every October. Right now, we're on Call of Duty: 
                    Modern Warfare and just like Activision has been doing with Overwatch for the last few years, the COD League has moved to a franchise-based system.

In simple terms, Live streaming is an activity where people record themselves online while others watch them. 

The practice became popular in the mid-2010s on sites dedicated only for this purpose. 

Professional streamers often combine high-level play and entertaining commentary, and earn income from sponsors, subscriptions,

 and donations. It's a real career now and not a temporary stop for people before they “get an actual job?”. 

Live streaming games online has changed the gaming industry, and made it is possible to choose streaming as a lifelong vocation and earn over 6 lakhs a year.

  <h3 class="display-5">When should I start thinking about a career as a streamer?</h3>
  <p class="lead" style="padding: 10px;">
Many people think that being a professional streamer is a piece of cake but they need to understand that only a person 

who is interactive with his/her viewers, and can play for hours while entertaining the community along the way, 

can become a professional streamer. Making money and building a career are not the same thing. 

In reality, making money is only one aspect of building a career, especially as a streamer.

Just remember these points if you want to make it big in the industry.<br>
<ul>
<li>Be entertaining</li>
<li>Be engaging</li>
<li>Do it for fun and not money</li>
</ul>
