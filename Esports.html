  <h3 class="display-5"> What is Esports?</h3>
  <p class="lead">Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) 
	   is a form of sport competition using video games. Esports describes the world of competitive, 
	   organized video gaming. Competitors from different leagues or teams face off in the same games 
	   that are popular with at-home gamers: Fortnite, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, 
	   Overwatch and Madden NFL, to name a few. These gamers are watched and followed by millions of fans
		all over the world, who attend live events or tune in on TV or online. Streaming services like Twitch 
		allow viewers to watch as their favorite gamers play in real time, and this is typically where popular 
		gamers build up their fandoms.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	

  <h3 class="display-5">Who watches Esports?</h3>
  <p class="lead">

A lot of people. According to a report from Newzoo, a market analytics company, 
380 million people worldwide watch esports, including 165 million esports 
enthusiasts (a term that describes frequent viewers, as opposed to occasional viewers). 
The bulk of these enthusiasts watch from North America, China and South Korea.
According to research from Newzoo, 588 major esports events were held in 2017.<br>

<br>
<br>

<h3 class="display-5">Where's the money in eSports?</h3>
  <p class="lead">

	With plenty of cash flowing into the picture, how do eSports teams and players earn money?
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Cash prizes:- </b> There is no shortage of prize money available to eSports gaming participants,
			 with single-game cash earnings up to $200,000. Some high-level competitions, like Dota 2 
			 International, earns $10 million to the competition's winning team. 
		</li>
		<br>

		<li> <b>Team salaries:- </b> Esports offers regular salaries to team participants,
			 with average salaries in the $3,000-to-$5,000 monthly in gaming hotbeds like 
			 China and the U.S. Top echelon players can earn much more, up to $15,000 for a 
			 single competition plus bonuses. Some teams even offer their players perks like 
			 health insurance and retirement plans. 
	   </li>
	   <br>

	   <li> <b>Sponsorship money:- </b> With major global brands in the picture, eSports is 
		 raking in the sponsorship cash. Some of that money goes into competition and cash prizes, 
		 and some go directly to team ownership, as is the case with Audi and its sponsorship of 
		 Astralis Counter Strike franchise. Sponsors comprise $456 million of the overall $1.1 billion
		 in eSports revenues this year, Newzoo reports. 
	   </li>
	   <br>
	   
	   <li> <b>Merchandising and tickets:- </b> At $103 million in revenues in 2019, 
		 merchandising and tickets are among the top tier leaders in eSports payouts.
		 That said, merchandising usually follows the ascension of a sport, as it 
		 historically has on the PGA tour, in the NFL and NBA, and in other popular 
		 professional sports leagues. Expect both merchandising and ticket revenues to 
		 climb as gaming continues to flourish on a global stage.

<p class="lead" style="margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
	Competitive gaming has been a popular pastime for decades, 
	but the money and industry around the top esports games is a relatively
	 recent development.
	 Esports is a multi-billion dollar industry that includes a plethora of titles in every genre,
	 from shooters to simulators and everything in-between. In no particular order, here are the
	 top esports games in 2020 based on a number of factors, including viewership, events, and overall success. 
</p>
<br>

<p style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px;">
	<h3 style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px; text-decoration: underline;">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
	<br>
	<a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/" ><img src="csgo.jpg" style="margin:10px 0px 10px 70px;"></a>
	<br>
	<p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Eight years since the launch of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) and it
	 has maintained its position as one of the top esports games in the world, with
	  frequent updates to the game, a lucrative market in weapon skins and knives, and 
	  a flurry of events every year. Alongside ongoing leagues like the BLAST Premier and 
	  ESL Pro League, 2020 has plenty of top tier tournaments like IEM Katowice 2020, DreamHack
	   Anaheim, and both ESL One events in Rio de Janeiro and Cologne respectively.

	  When it comes to viewership, the biggest tournament in 2019 for CS:GO was the IEM Katowice major, 
	  which accumulated 1.2 million views with a $1 million prize pool. This is another million in the total 
	  prize money awarded since 2013, which is currently at just over $91 million.
	</p>
</p>
<br>

<p style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px;">
	<h3 style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px; text-decoration: underline;">League of Legends</h3>
	<br>
	<a href="https://play.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB"><img src="lol.jpg" style="margin:10px 0px 10px 70px;"></a>
	<br>
	<p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Perhaps the most famous esport in the world, 
		League of Legends (LoL) is one of two Massive Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) dominating
		 the esports industry. It's been almost 11 years since LoL launched, and the grand total
		  prize money awarded is a whopping $73.5m across over 2,400 events.
		  South Korea is by far the most popular and successful market for LoL, with eight of the top 10 earners
		   hailing from the nation. In fact, only one player in the top 25 — Luka "PerkZ" Perkovic — comes from a
			country other than South Korea or China, showing the popularity and dominance of the two Asian countries 
			within LoL.
	</p>
</p>
<br>

<p style="margin: 0px 70px 10px 70px;">
	<h3 style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px; text-decoration: underline;">Fortnite</h3>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home"><img src="fortnite.jpg" style="margin:10px 0px 10px 70px;"></a>
	<br>
	<p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Some will say Fortnite isn't a proper esport due to Epic's 
		tendency to roll out changes right before big events and reluctancy to maintain a healthy competitive metagame, 
		but that doesn't detract from the fact that over $80 million has been given out in rewards in just over two years.
		 The game took the world by storm when it launched in September 2017 and while the buzz in the general media has died out, 
		 the esports scene is still thriving.How many people play Fortnite is a question plenty of people ask, and as of March 2019 – 
		 so almost a year ago – Fortnite had 250 million registered users.
	</p>
</p>
<br>

<p style="margin: 0px 70px 10px 70px;">
	<h3 style="margin: 0px 70px 0px 70px; text-decoration: underline;">DOTA 2</h3>
	<br>
	<a href="http://blog.dota2.com/?l=english"><img src="dota2.jpg" style="margin:10px 0px 10px 70px;"></a>
	<br>
	<p style="margin: 0px 200px 0px 70px;">Dota 2 is the only direct competitor to League of Legends and it comes from Valve, 
		the same studio behind CS:GO. While LoL is immensely popular in Asian regions, the top 25 earners in Dota 2 are spread across
		 16 different nations, including the U.S.A, China, France, and Romania.
		 When it comes to prize money, Dota 2 blows every other title out of the water thanks to the method of funding used.
		 25% of all proceeds go towards The International prize pool, which meant that The International 2019 had a whopping $34.3m available, 
		 on top of the $200m+ that has been on offer over the years.
	</p>

<br>

<p style="margin: 0px 70px 10px 70px;">
	<h3 style="margin: 0px 70px 10px 70px; text-decoration: underline;">Honourable Mentions</h3>
	
	<p style="margin: 0px 200px 50px 70px;">Of course, these aren't the only esports. There's hundreds of games played at a competitive level, 
		including Farming Simulator – seriously. Titles that just missed out on a spot in the top list include both PUBG and Apex Legends, 
		two successful battle royale games that are unfortunately living in the shadow of Fortnite. There's also PUBG Mobile, which is impressively
		 even more popular than its mainstream counterpart.
		 <br>
		 One of the only esports to be played on console, the competitive Call of Duty scene is unique in the fact it moves on to a brand new title every year.
		  Thanks to Call of Duty's annual release schedule, players have to learn the ins and outs of a whole new game every October. Right now, we're on Call of Duty: 
		  Modern Warfare and just like Activision has been doing with Overwatch for the last few years, the COD League has moved to a franchise-based system.
